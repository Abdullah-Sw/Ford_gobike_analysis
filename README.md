## Dataset

> This data set is taken from https://www.fordgobike.com/system-data and represents trips taken by members of the service for month of February of 2019.<br>
Data consists of info about trips taken by service's members, their types, their age, their gender, stations of starting and ending trips, duration of trips etc.<br><br>


## Summary of Findings

> Univariate exploration: The difference between males and females is basically that there are so many males compared to females. males represents 76.2% of the dataset while females 23.8%.
Bivariate exploration: I managed to show every birth date year along with their maximum duration hour.
Multivariate exploration: Customer's end station 'San Francisco Ferry Building (Harry Bridges Plaza)' is the highest, with Day being more common than Night.<br><br>


## Key Insights for Presentation

> 1- Males and Females are usually compared in the dataset to check which one is more often.<br>
2- The maximum duration hour is determined by plotly library, it can show the maximum point and display the hours by just clicking it.<br>
3- There is a lot of ends stations but Customers end's station is either during day or during night.
